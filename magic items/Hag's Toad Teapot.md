This dark green teapot is in the shape of a toad with one twistable wart in its back.

Endless Hot Tea. The tea pot will always pour black tea at the perfect temperature for drinking. However many cups are made there is always enough water left in the pot.

Poisonous Wart. Turning the wart on the tea pot will make any tea poured from it poisonous when consumed. Creatures must make a DC10 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hr.
