name: 'Siren Fairy's Music Box'
---
This music box appears to have a petrified creature half-fairy half-fish within it and is well-worn. 

**_Enchanting Tune._** When the music box is open it plays a haunting tune, up to 4 creatures within hearing range chosen but the one who opens the box must make a Wisdom saving throw DC 14 or become charmed for 1 hour, lured toward the box. Creatures will know they've been charmed after the spell ends.

If a creature succeeds its save throw the music has no effect, if a lured creature suffers damage the effect ends. Use recharges after a long rest.
