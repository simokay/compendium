This silver ring with purple gems is thicker on the finger than might usually be expected

**_Create Sweet Treat._**Â Once per long rest the wearer can create any sweet treat they can imagine no larger than a cake or smaller than a boiled sweet and it will appear after a few seconds in front of them.

When in range, unless a creature is adverse to sweet things or a particular food they will be drawn to the treat and take an interest in it.

If they consume the entire treat the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed, following the effects of Charm Person spell.
