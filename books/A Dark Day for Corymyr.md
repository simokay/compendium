*by Bardraskur*

Its flowery musings and warnings eerily foreshadowed the events that took place in the past, when the mythical Lost Spell was unearthed in Cormyr known as the spellstorm. It was a powerful enchantment designed centuries ago by the presumed dead god of spells â€” a spell long thought lost to the ages.

It warned of the spell as a powerful lure, to wizards of every stripe, only to trap them inside and make their magic useless.

_"Seek no morrow, but make war ready; heed what I darkly warn, for you face blood, sorrow, fell treachery, and dread spellstorm."_
