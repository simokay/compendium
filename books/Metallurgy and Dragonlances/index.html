    <p>Dragonmetal was a liquid metal of pure, cool silver that could be found beneath the Silver Dragon Mountain in Foghaven Vale, and another in the Kharolis Mountains on Ansalon. This metal is very rare and very valuable, and  lighter than steel, just as strong, and has magical properties. With the use of both the Silver Arm of Ergoth and the Hammer of Kharas, dragonmetal could be used to forge dragonlances.</p>
<p>If you should unfortunately only have one of the two artifacts it is still possible, with great skill, to forge a dragonlance, but these are referred to as lesser dragonlances compared to lances made with both artifacts.</p>
