Souls, my friend. The spirits of evil mortals. On the dire planes, these souls are traded among the powerful fiends the way mortals might exchange a gem or a trinket.

The souls are tormented and filled with as much despair as they can bare before being contained within a coin.

A soul coin is made from infernal iron. Both sides of the coin have infernal script etched onto the surface.

Most soul coins are minted on Minauros. Trapped souls are infused into the coins by greater devils and then distributed throughout the Nine Hells as currency.
