    <p>The book starts with a general history of the arena and then goes on to detail some of the gorier moments in its history.</p>
<p>The Imperial Arena in the city of Kristophan is one hundred paces across, and the seats could hold twenty thousand. There is standing room in the arena for at least forty thousand. Great warriors compete in trials against one another most of the time. But on occasion it is used for gladiators to battle against those charged with treason or other crimes. The arena is sometimes used for large Minotaur festivals, during which non-minotaurs are not allowed entry and must instead celebrate in the nearby Plaza of the Champions.</p>
<p>In 424 AC, when a great earthquake shook the city, the arena managed to survive the devastation. Duke Rekhaz An-Thurn converted the arena into a keep at this time, to serve as his base of operations in managing the city after the disaster.</p>
