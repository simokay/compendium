---
The book starts with a general history of the arena and then goes on to detail some of the gorier moments in its history.  

The Imperial Arena in the city of Kristophan was one hundred paces across, and the seats could hold twenty thousand. There was standing room in the arena for at least forty thousand. Great warriors competed in trials against one another most of the time. But on occasion it was used for gladiators to battle against those charged with treason or other crimes. The arena was sometimes used for large Minotaur festivals, during which non-minotaurs were not allowed entry and must instead celebrate in the nearby Plaza of the Champions.
