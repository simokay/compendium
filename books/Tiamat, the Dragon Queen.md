name: "Tiamat, the Dragon Queen"
---
Tiamat was the dragon goddess of greed, queen of evil dragons. Her eternal rival was her brother, Bahamut, ruler of the metallic dragons.

Tiamat was a unique chromatic dragon, who had one head for each primary colour of the most common species of chromatics (black, blue, green, red, white). Each head was able to operate entirely independently of each other and had the powers of a member of the respective race of dragonkind. Her body also had traits in common with a wyvern, including a long tail tipped with a venomous stinger.

As a unique type of chromatic dragon with the traits of the five most common chromatic varieties, Tiamat was a foe to be reckoned with in battle.

Tiamat kept an active watch over evil dragonkind and always stirred them to further actions of avarice, pride and wickedness. In recent times, however, her primary goal was to break free from the Nine Hells.
