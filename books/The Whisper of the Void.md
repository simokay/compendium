*By Rivalen Tanthul*

A thick black book, with gold trim. The book is slightly covered in dirt and soil. There is an inscription inside the cover that reads:

"To the weakest of us, may our family history bring you strength. VT"

"Our once great city, hung like a dark jewel in the skies over Faerûn. Before our kingdom was broken, when the enclave fell to pieces. But the strength of the Tanthuls remains. Gathering in number, on that truer plane, in the ever grey and darkest shade. One day the great city of Thultanthar is sure to rise again, back into the heavens above."

"That old mage of Candlekeep, Elminster, is a curse on our family and all shades. It was him, in his hubris, that destroyed the two great cities of Anauroch. Rather than accepting the majesty of shadow that would fall over the land.

He is a reckless purveyor of magic, a clumsy child with his hands on the lesser weave. His use of mythals is no match for the superior Mythallar. It is a wonder such vessels are not blowing up all the time."

"After the fall of Thultanthar a great number of its citizens were lost. Some found their way back to the shadowfell, Others searched the land for new homes and new loyalties. The Thanthuls, and those closest to them, went south into the Forests of Cormyr where pathways to the shadowfell were plentiful…

…hunted by the Knights of Myth Drannor many were believed killed including Vattick Tanthul."
