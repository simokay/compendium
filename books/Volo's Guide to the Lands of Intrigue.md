This books appears to be a travelogue about the realms of Amn and Tethyr.

#### Amn
- a land of a tremendously wealthy merchants, tough prices unless you can haggle well.
- capital city of Athkatla has a wonderful shrine to Chauntea
- weather is pleasant almost all the year round except in Uktar when the heavy rain starts
- hot springs at Lake Esmel seem like a good idea
#### Tethyr
- mountains here are meant to be the tallest in all Faer√ªn
- summers in Tethyr are very long
- the capital, Darromar, seems to have a thirst for monster hunting
- The country seems very much in a state of repair still after the civil war.
