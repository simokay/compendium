<div class="item-details">
 <div class="more-info-content">
    <p>In ancient Netheril six major languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low Netherese, spoken in Low Netheril during the reign of the first empire and before the Karsus' Folly. After its death, it has made a resurgence due to the rise of the second Netherese Empire.</li>
<li>Loross, often called 'High Netherese', was the language of the nobles in High Netheril before Karsus' Folly. It was presumed dead and lost forever until the return of the Shade Enclave, where it served as the primary language.</li>
<li>Halruaan, spoken in the Netherese successor states of Halruaa and Nimbral.</li>
<li>Uloushinn, a creole language spoken by the Bedine tribes of the Anauroch, having influences from both Low Netherese and the Zakharan Midani language.</li>
<li>D'tarig, spoken by the D'tarig tribes of the Anauroch, this language is influenced heavily by the Dethek language of the Dwarves.</li>
<li>Ruathlek, a secret language used by Illusionists in Faer√ªn.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the city of Thultanthar returned from the shadow realm Loross was spoken there once again. With speakers of low Netherese becoming increasingly rare as survivors of the empire fled.</p>
<p>The city of Thultanthar also bought back other informal language known as the 'Shadar-kai' presumably from some native beings of the Shadowfell.</p>
<p>The book also includes a very basic pronunciation guide for each language along with a few words and phrases.</p>
