A guide dedicated to what contracts and which devils were the most compatible with each other.

"Remember, devils are not only fiends - they're bastards. I once knew a man who asked for ultimate protection against his enemies from a devil of Dispater. He was transported into an impregnable iron fortress deep underground: one without doors. So, pick and choose with caution, friends"

The archdevils are powerful, unique devils, the most powerful of which are lords of the Nine Hells, but best not make packs with the lords themselves.  What follows is a list by which hell a devil can be found within.

### Avernus
For packs relating to war Bel and Qirozz, though if there are dragons involved Amduscias and Malphas might be best.
### Dis
Dispater for packs related to vigilance,  Arioch for vengeance, Biffant for learning.
### Minauros
Mammon for greed, Bael for battle, Focalor for property.
### Phlegethos
Belial for vanity, Chamo for wealth, Balan for health and strength
### Stygia
Geryon for wishes, Agares for  disguises.
### Malbolge
Tartach for tormenting others.
### Maladomini
Baalzebul or Neabaz for deception.
### Cania
Hutijin for weather and storms
### Nessus
Phongor for spies and rumours. Rimmon for fires. Zagum for theatrics.
