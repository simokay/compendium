_tenets of the cult of the dragon by Sammaster_

_**"And naught will be left save shattered thrones with no rulers. But the dead dragons shall rule the world entire"**_

_~ Maglas_

_The highest of our rank will be the Wearers of Purple. Next will be the Keepers of the Secret Hoard. Those new recruits will be known as Followers of the Scaly Way_

_The symbol of the Cult of the Dragon is to be a black flame with eyes above a dragon's claw._

 _Anyone may form a cell, though joining an existing one is preferable. Seek out and serve the dragons of Faerûn who are amenable to the cults aims. Gathering intelligence for them, contributing treasure to their hoards, and generally making alliances with them and aiding them in any way possible, all in an effort to gain the cooperation of these dragons and entice them into being transformed into dracoliches._
