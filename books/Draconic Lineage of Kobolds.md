---
Kobolds are considered by many to the first of the dragonspawn created by the true will of Tiamat. While others believe the were created along with the Urd by the great Asgorath, the creator of all things.

For a time it is said they lived amongst great dragons as their helpers and guardians. The most powerful of which was the dragon Caesinsjach. The majesty of her draconic lands stood for thousands of years and along with **Kurtulmak** god of all kobolds obtained a great many gemstones. 

The gnome deity Garl Glittergold was envious of the achievements the kobolds had made, which dwarfed those of his own people. Out of spite, he cruelly collapsed the kobold fortress, massacring them all.
