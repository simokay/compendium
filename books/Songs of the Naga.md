A small notebook of maybe 10 songs about Naga such as:

Down in the temples where the black roots breathe,  
I heard the hiss of an eternal seethe.  
Eyes like moons in a deathless void,  
Scales that shimmer where time's destroyed.

Their tongues write runes in the starlit ash,  
Casting spells with a thunderous crash.  
Old are the bones of forgotten kings 
O Serpents! O Undying Rings!

Praise be to the coiled lords,  
Wreathed in rot and silver chords!  
Serpents from beyond the veil,  
Where suns burn out and gods grow pale!
We crawl, we bleed, we chant your names —  
O Great Ones, rise with your moonlit and fangs!

The spirit wears the finest crown past from king to king,  
Ruling from beneath the hills, I hope he hears us sing.  
Beneath the altar of bone and brass,  
I saw them shed the skin of past.  
One hiss, and stars collapsed in line —  
Their gaze rewrites the laws of time.

Praise be to the coiled lords,  
Wreathed in rot and silver chords!  
Serpents from beyond the veil,  
Where suns burn out and gods grow pale!
We crawl, we bleed, we chant your names —  
O Great Ones, rise with your moonlit and fangs!
