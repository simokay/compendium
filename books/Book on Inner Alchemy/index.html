    <p><em>by the Ren Brothers</em></p>
<p>In appearance, it was an unremarkable book of average thickness in olive-green covers. It was very well made and in excellent condition, bar slight damage to the corners. Within, it had both paper pages displaying and silk sheets with painted illustrations, with silk threads used to sew them into the binding. While the paper had aged, the illustrations on silk remained fresh and clear.</p>
<p>The text was written in the Shou language in Shou Chiang characters, in columns that ran from top to bottom and right to left. The illustrations were medical diagrams indicating the flow of ki through a humanoid body and methods for its cultivation.</p>
<p>The Book of Inner Alchemy contained much esoteric lore on ki and the mental, physical, and spiritual techniques used to cultivate and manipulate it in healing, martial arts, or other extraordinary acts. These focused on meditation, controlled breathing, and a disciplined spirit. However, these were but the fundamentals of ki.</p>
<p>It went on to detail martial arts techniques involving the pressure points on humanoid bodies and how to strike at and even steal ki from another. It presented theories on how to combine the natural energies of &quot;the primordial trifecta&quot; of essence (that is, body), mind, and soul and even how one might join their physical and spiritual parts of oneself to become immortal. However, it observed that one embarking on his was likely to encounter obstacles: a lack of wisdom could corrupt the soul, violent acts could taint the body, and ego and emotional attachment could weaken the mind.</p>
<p>Certain pages remain suspiciously blank.</p>
