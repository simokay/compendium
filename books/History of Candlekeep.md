*By Cirian*

"As it became clear that the Shadovar had infiltrated Candlekeep, tensions escalated. Elminster, the Moonstars, and Sharrans loyal to the Tanthuls plotted to destroy or capture the mythal's power.

During the great battle for Candlekeep, 1487 DR, Elminster was betrayed by the lich Larloch who took control of the mythals power leaving Candlekeep vulnerable for a short time, until Elminster was able to restore the shield.
