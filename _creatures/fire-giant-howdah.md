***Howdah.*** The fire giant carries a compact fort on
its back. Up to four Medium creatures can ride in
the fort without squeezing. Creatures in the fort
are 15 feet from the ground, out of range of melee
weapons. Creatures in the fort have three-quarters
cover against attacks and effects from outside it. If
the fire giant dies, creatures in the fort are placed
in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the fire giant.
