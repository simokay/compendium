***Echolocation.*** The bat can’t use its blindsight while
deafened.

***Flyby.*** The bat doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks
when it flies out of an enemies reach.

***Keen Hearing.*** The bat has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 +2) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions

***Goblin Boomer (2/Day).*** As a bonus action, the
sky raider bat drops a ceramic pot of alchemist’s
fire on a random target. The target must succeed
on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4)
fire damage, and 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of
each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by
using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to
extinguish the flames.
