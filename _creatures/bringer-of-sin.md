***Aura of Pain.*** A creature that deals damage to the
bringer while within 30 feet of it takes 5 (1d10)
necrotic damage.

***Light Seeker.*** The bringer knows the exact location of
any good creature within 1000 feet.

***Magic Resistance.*** The bringer has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bringer makes two melee attacks, one
of which may be a punishing strike.

***Glaive.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage plus
22 (5d8) necrotic damage if the creature is good.

***Punishing Strike (3/Day).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing
damage plus half of the total damage that creature
dealt to the bringer with its last attack as bonus
necrotic damage.

***Wave of Necrosis (Recharge 5-6).*** The bringer lets loose
a blast of necrotic energy in a 60 foot cone. Each
creature allied with the bringer regains 50 hit points
and each enemy must make a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.
