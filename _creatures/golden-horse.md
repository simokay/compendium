***Immutable Form.*** The golden horse is immune to any
spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golden horse has advantage
on saving throws against spells and other magical
effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The golden horse’s weapon attacks
are magical.

***Trampling Charge.*** If the golden horse moves at
least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then
hits it with a hooves attack on the same turn, that
target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving
throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone,
the golden horse can make another attack with its
hooves against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The golden horse makes two hoof
attacks.

***Hooves.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

***Slow (Recharge 5–6).*** The golden horse targets one
or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each
target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw
against this magic. On a failed save, a target can’t
use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make
more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the
target can take either an action or a bonus action on
its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
