finishes a short rest, it can regain up to 3 total
expended spell slots.

***Arcane Ward.*** When the spellshield casts its first
abjuration spell of 1st level or higher for the day, it
gains 16 temporary hit points. After these
temporary hit points have been reduced to 0, any
additional abjuration spells the spellshield casts
this day provide 5 temporary hit points.

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>alarm, mage armor, shield</i>
