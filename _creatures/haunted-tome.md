***Cursed Contents.*** Any creature that writes its name
within this tome becomes affected by a streak of
terrible luck. When any of those creatures are
making a critical skill check (DM's discretion), that
creature makes the roll with disadvantage as some
random misfortune befalls them. These misfortunes
automatically become documented within the
pages of the tome along with humorous and
degrading remarks regarding the outcome. When
the tome is destroyed or someone else writes their
name in the book, the curse is lifted.

***False Appearance.*** While the tome remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal
book. It will always brandish a name such as <i>Power
and Wealth</i> or <i>Rags to Riches</i> and will appear in
pristine condition. The contents of the book
encourage a reader to write its name within the
pages with promises of power.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.
