***Aggressive Charge.*** On its first turn in combat, before
moving or taking any actions, the tigerpede can
spend its entire movement to move up to twice its
speed toward a hostile creature it can see.

***Keen Sight and Smell.*** The tigerpede has advantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or
smell.

***Sure-Footed.*** The tigerpede has advantage on
Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against
effects that would knock it prone.

***Tackle.*** If the tigerpede tiger moves at least 20 feet
straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore
attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5
(2d4) slashing damage. If the target is prone, the
tigerpede can make a bite attack against it as a bonus
action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The tigerpede makes two attacks: one
with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage, and if
the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
