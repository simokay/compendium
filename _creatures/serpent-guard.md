***Capitalize (1/Turn).*** If the Amazon hits a creature
that she can see with a melee weapon attack, she can
use her bonus action to immediately make another
melee weapon attack against the same creature. This
extra attack has disadvantage.

***Fear of Magic.*** If a creature casts a spell or uses another
magical effect within 30 feet of the Amazon and the
Amazon can see it, the Amazon must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the
spellcaster's spell save DC. On a failed saving throw,
the Amazon is frightened of the spellcaster for 1
minute. The Amazon can repeat her saving throw at the
end of each of her turns, ending the frightened effect
on a success. If the Amazon succeeds on her initial
saving throw or the effect ends for her, this trait does
not function for 1 hour.

***Serpent Whisperer.*** Through sounds and gestures, the
Amazon can communicate simple ideas with snakes
and other serpents.

***Shield Guardian.*** When the Amazon takes the Dodge
action and she is wielding a shield, she gains a +3
bonus to her AC.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Amazon makes three attacks with her
tepoztopilli.

***Tepoztopilli.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10
ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, or
9 (1d10 + 4) bludgeoning when wielded with two
hands.

***Sling.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/120
ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

***Shield Bash.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be
knocked prone.
