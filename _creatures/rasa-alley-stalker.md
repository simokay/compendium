ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12). It can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no
components:

* At will: <i>mage hand, message</i>

* 1/day each: <i>disguise self, silent image</i>

***Mask of Shadows.*** The alley stalker has a mask
enchanted to make them a threat in shadowed
areas and when striking the first blow on an enemy.
The alley stalker has advantage on stealth checks
and its attacks against surprised enemies are always
considered a critical hit.

magical effects to determine if it is lying.

regarded as a friend or a foe.
