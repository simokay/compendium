***Feline Grace.*** The knave has a climb speed equal to
its movement speed and does not take fall damage
from heights less than 30 feet. In addition, the
knave's footsteps are completely silent.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The knave deals an extra 14
(4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon
attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when
the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the knave
that isn't incapacitated and the knave doesn't have
disadvantage on the attack roll.

***Spellcasting.*** The knave is a 3th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is wisdom (spell save DC 15, +7
to hit with spell attacks). The knave has the
following druid spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>mending, thorn whip</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>fog cloud, jump, longstrider</i>

* 2nd level (2 slots): <i>darkvision, enhance ability, locate object</i>

***Wild Shape - Cat (2/Short Rest).*** As a bonus action,
the knave transforms into a cat for up to two hours.
When the cat is reduced to 0 hit points, the knave
reverts to its normal form, with any excess damage
carrying over to the knave's hit points.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The knave makes two attacks with its
claws.

***Steel Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.
