***Hardened Exterior.*** Bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage the overlord takes from nonmagical
weapons is reduced by 3 to a minimum of 1.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The overlord's innate spellcasting
ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13). It can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:

* At will: <i>light, shape stone</i>

* 3/day each: <i>transmute rock, wall of stone</i>

* 1/day each: <i>bones of the earth</i>

***Stone Camouflage.*** The overlord has advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in rocky terrain.

***Sturdy.*** The overlord has advantage on saving throws
against effects that would cause it to move or be
knocked prone.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The overlord makes two attacks with its
stone gauntlet or with its stone spike.

***Stone Gauntlet.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning
damage.

***Stone Spike.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range
30/90 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing
damage.

***Rupturing Wave (Recharge 5-6).*** The overlord slams its
gauntleted first to the ground and causes a 10-foot
wide, 60-foot long line of jagged stone erupts from the
ground. Each creature in the line must make a DC 14
Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d8) bludgeoning
damage and 22 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. The area
in this line is considered difficult terrain until the
rubble is cleared.

***From the Rubble (1/Day).*** The overlord uses spare stone
and rubble in the area to restore health to its allies. Up
to four other corlapis the overlord can see regain 22
(4d8 + 4) hit points.

### Legendary Actions

The overlord can take 2 legendary actions, choosing
from the options below. Only one legendary action can
be used at a time and only at the end of another
creatureâ€™s turn. The overlord regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Punch.*** The overlord makes a stone gauntlet attack.

***Stone Cover.*** The overlord summons a 5-foot wide, 5-
foot tall, 3-inch thick wall of stone in an unoccupied
space within 10 feet. This wall has AC 15 and 30 hit
points and persists until it is destroyed.

***Giant Boulder (3 actions).*** The overlord summons a 15-
foot diameter boulder 30 feet in the air at a point it can
see within 120 feet. The boulder immediately falls to
the ground and any creature in the area of impact must
succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 36
(8d8) bludgeoning damage and become restrained,
pinned beneath the boulder. The restrained creature
can use an action to make a DC 14 Strength or
Dexterity saving throw (creature's choice). On a
success, the creature is no longer restrained. A creature
that passed the initial saving throw moves to a location
adjacent to the boulder and takes no damage.
