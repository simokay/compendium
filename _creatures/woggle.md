***Woggle Woggle.*** The woggle babbles in its bizarre
woggle-speak while it can see any creature and isn’t
incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within
20 feet of the woggle and can hear it must succeed
on a DC 11 Intelligence saving throw or be cursed
with woggle-speak. The cursed target loses all of its
languages and can only speak and write the word
"woggle." While cursed, casting a spell that includes
a verbal component is impossible. Woggle-speak is
gibberish and can’t be understood with a
comprehend languages spell or similar magic, nor
understood by others with the same curse.
Telepathy, mind-reading, and other spells used for
non-verbal communication similarly don’t work as
the cursed creature can only create images of the
word “woggle” or a physical woggle in its mind. The
curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell
or other magic. Creatures immune to being charmed
automatically succeed on the saving throw. A
creature that succeeds on its saving throw is
immune to this effect for 24 hours.

***Two Heads.*** The woggle has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks and on saving throws against
being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened,
stunned, and knocked unconscious.
