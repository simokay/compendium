***Floral Camouflage.*** While the badger remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a very large
flower.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.

***Petal Burst (1/Day).*** The badger arches its body and
fires a burst of razor sharp petals at a creature
within 20 feet. That creature must make a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (4d4) slashing
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
