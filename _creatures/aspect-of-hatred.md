***Aura of Rage.*** Living creatures within 30 feet of the
aspect are filled with a blinding rage. The first
weapon attack each turn made by a creature within
this aura is made with disadvantage. This effect
ends when the aspect is reduced to 0 hit points.

***Immutable Form.*** The aspect is immune to any spell
or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The aspect has advantage on
saving throws against spell and other magical
effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The aspect's weapon attacks are
magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The aspect makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

***Wave of Rage (1/Day).*** Each hostile creature within
30 feet of the aspect must succeed on a DC 13
Wisdom saving throw or become filled with an
insatiable bloodlust for one minute. Any creature
that failed the save must take the attack action on
each of its turns and cannot use its bonus action. A
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.
