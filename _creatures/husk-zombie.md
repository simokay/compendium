***Curse of the Husk.*** A humanoid slain by a melee attack from the zombie revives as a husk zombie on its next turn.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The zombie makes two claw attacks. For each of these attacks that reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the zombie can make an additional claw attack.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
