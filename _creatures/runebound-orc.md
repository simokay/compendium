***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the orc can move up
to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can
see.

***Runebound.*** The orc's body is coated in magical
runes granted by a runespeaker that provide it with
additional strength. The orc gains one of the
following runic bonuses:
* Rune of Brutality – When the orc hits a creature
with less than its maximum hit points, the attack
deals an additional 5 (1d10) slashing damage.
* Rune of Fortitude – The orc's AC is increased to
16. In addition, as long as the orc has at least 1
hit point, it regenerates 5 hit points at the start
of its turn.
* Rune of Strength – The orc's greataxe attacks
deal an additional 3 slashing damage and it has
advantage on Strength-based checks and saving
throws.

***Runic Weapon.*** The orc's greataxe is imbued with
powerful arcane runes, causing attacks with that
weapon to deal an additional 4 (1d8) force damage
(included in the attack).

### Actions

***Runic Greataxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d12 + 3) slashing
damage plus 4 (1d8) force damage.
