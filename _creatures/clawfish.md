***Hold Breath.*** The clawfish can hold their breath for
15 minutes.

### Actions

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) slashing damage, and if the target is a Small or
larger creature, the clawfish can pull themself into the target’s
space and attach to the target. While attached, the clawfish
moves with the target without provoking opportunity attacks,
and the clawfish can’t make Claw attacks. A creature who can
reach the clawfish can use an action to make a DC 12 Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a success, the
clawfish is detached and shunted into an unoccupied space
of the clawfish’s choice within 5 feet of the target. The clawfish
also detaches if they become grappled, incapacitated, prone,
or restrained, or if they use 5 feet of movement to detach.

***Electrocute (Recharge 6).*** Each creature touching the
clawfish takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage. If the clawfish is
immersed in water, each other creature within 10 feet of
the clawfish who is touching the same body of water must
succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take the
same damage.
