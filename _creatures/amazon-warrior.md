***Capitalize (1/Turn).*** If the Amazon hits a creature
that she can see with a melee weapon attack, she can
use her bonus action to immediately make another
melee weapon attack against the same creature. This
extra attack has disadvantage.

***Fear of Magic.*** If a creature casts a spell or uses another
magical effect within 30 feet of the Amazon and the
Amazon can see it, the Amazon must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the
spellcaster's spell save DC. On a failed saving throw,
the Amazon is frightened of the spellcaster for 1
minute. The Amazon can repeat her saving throw at the
end of each of her turns, ending the frightened effect
on a success. If the Amazon succeeds on her initial
saving throw or the effect ends for her, this trait does
not function for 1 hour.

***Serpent Whisperer.*** Through sounds and gestures, the
Amazon can communicate simple ideas with snakes
and other serpents.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Amazon makes two attacks with her
macuahuitl.

***Macuahuitl.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning or slashing
damage (Amazon's choice), or 8 (1d10 + 3)
bludgeoning or slashing damage (Amazon's choice)
when wielded with two hands.

***Javelin.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5 ft., or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

***Shield Bash.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If
the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must
succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be
knocked prone.
