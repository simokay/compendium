***Magic Resistance.*** The machine lieutenant has
advantage on saving throws against spells and
other magical effects.

***Both Guard and Ward.*** While the lieutenant is
within 5 feet of the attuned owner of the codex
automata, any attack targeting the codex’s
owner has a 50% chance to instead target the
machine lieutenant.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The lieutenant makes two
longsword attacks.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing
damage or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used
with two hands.
