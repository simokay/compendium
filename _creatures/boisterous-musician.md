***Cutting Words (2/Short Rest).*** When a creature that
the musician can see within 50 feet makes an
attack roll, ability check, or a damage roll, the
musician sings a quick disruptive melody. Roll a d8
and subtract the number from the creature's roll.

***Inspire (2/Short Rest).*** Target uninspired creature
within 60 feet of the musician that can hear it gains
a d8 inspiration die. Once within the next 10
minutes, that creature can roll that die and add the
number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or
saving throw it makes. This die must be rolled
before it is decided if the roll succeeds or fails.
