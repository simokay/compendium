***Labyrinthine Recall.*** The crawler can perfectly recall
any path it has traveled.

***Flawless Tracker.*** The crawler can track down any
creature it has smelled in the last 24 hours unless
that creature's location is concealed through
magical means.

### Actions

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Befuddling Screech (1/Day).*** The crawler lets out an
ear piercing screech in a 30-foot cone that
reverberates in frequencies that cause the minds of
most creatures to become scrambled. Each
creature in this cone must succeed on a DC 11
Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (1d10) psychic
damage and lose its sense of time and direction for
1 hour.
