***Arctic Camouflage.*** The arctic chimera has advantage on
Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in arctic terrain.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The chimera makes three attacks: one
with its bite, one with its horns, and one with its
claws. When its Cold Breath is available, it can use the
breath in place of its bite or horns.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

***Horns.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 10 (1d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon head exhales
a freezing blast of icy air in a 15-foot
cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) cold damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
