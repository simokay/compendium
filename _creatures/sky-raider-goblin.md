***Nimble Escape.*** The goblin can take the Disengage
or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

### Actions

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 +2) piercing damage.

***Light Crossbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range
80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 +2) piercing damage.

***Grenado (3/Day).*** As an action the goblin can
throw a grenado to a point it can see within 30 feet.
When a grenado is thrown, roll initiative for it. The
grenado explodes on its next turn. When a grenado
explodes, all creatures within 10 feet must succeed
on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6)
piercing and 3 (1d6) fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much on a successful one. The grenado also
ignites flammable materials in the area.

### Reactions

***Parachute.*** The goblin can deploy the parachute as
a reaction while falling, or as an action otherwise.
The parachute requires at least a 10 foot cube of
unoccupied space in which to deploy, and it doesnâ€™t
open fast enough to slow a fall of less than 60 ft. If
it has sufficient time and space to deploy properly,
the parachute allows its wearer to land without
taking falling damage. Once it has been used, the
parachute takes 10 minutes to repack.
