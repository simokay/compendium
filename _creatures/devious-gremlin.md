gremlin dies, the contents of its pouch explode out
of its body in a violent eruption.

saving throws against spells and other magical
effects.

space as narrow as one inch wide while squeezing.

Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks and Charisma
(Persuasion) checks when interacting with Small or
smaller beasts. Through sounds and gestures, it can
also communicate with Small or smaller beasts.
