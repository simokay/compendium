***Spellcasting.*** The songwriter is a 3th-level spellcaster.
Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The songwriter has
the following bard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>dancing lights, message, vicious mockery</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>charm person, comprehend languages, tasha's hideous laughter</i>

* 2nd level (2 slots): <i>enhance ability, hold person, silence</i>

***Cutting Words (3/Short Rest).*** When a creature that
the songwriter can see within 50 feet makes an
attack roll, ability check, or a damage roll, the
songwriter sings a quick disruptive melody. Roll a d8
and subtract the number from the creature's roll.

### Actions
