***Innate Spellcasting.*** The rasa's innate spellcasting
ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12). It can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no
components:

* At will: <i>mage hand, message</i>

* 1/day each: <i>disguise self, silent image</i>

* 2/day each: <i>misty step</i>

***Inscrutable Intentions.*** The rasa is immune to any
magical effects to determine if it is lying.

***Mask of Debilitation.*** While wearing this mask, the
cutthroat's weapon attacks inflict a delayed paralysis on
the target. On hit, the target must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution saving throw against paralysis. On a failed
save, the target's body begins to stiffen and is
restrained. A restrained creature must repeat this
saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming
paralyzed for 1 minute on a failed save. On a success,
this effect ends and the creature is immune to the
Mask of Debilitation effect for 24 hours.

***Mask of Subtlety.*** While wearing this mask, a target hit
by the cutthroat's dagger cannot speak until the start
of the cutthroat's next turn. In addition, the cutthroat
can Hide or Disengage as a bonus action on each of its
turns.

***Sight of the Rasa.*** The rasa share a special sight that
is invisible to all non-rasa creatures. As an action, a
rasa can touch a creature and place a secret mark
on that creature's chest. This mark lets other rasa
know whether or not this creature should be
regarded as a friend or a foe.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The rasa makes two melee attacks.

***Poisoned Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5
to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5
(1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) poison
damage.

***Explosive Coin (1/Day).*** The cutthroat throws a gold
coin on the ground and sets it to either immediately
detonate or to detonate when another creature
attempts to pick it up. When the coin is triggered, each
creature within 5 feet of the coin must make a DC 12
Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. If the coin is not triggered within 24 hours, it
becomes a mundane gold coin.
