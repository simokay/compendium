***Rampage.*** When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0
hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll
can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed
and make a bite attack.

***Thrill of the Hunt.*** When the gnoll hits a creature
with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra
1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. The
gnoll can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gnoll makes two melee attacks
with its spear or two ranged attacks with its longbow.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit,
reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5
(1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing
damage when used with two hands to make a melee
attack.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range
150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing
damage, and the target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet
until the end of its next turn.
