***Power in Numbers.*** The swarm has advantage on an
attack roll against a creature if the swarm has at
least half of its maximum hit points.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's
space and vice versa, and the swarm can move
through any opening large enough for a Medium
bandit. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain
temporary hit points.

### Actions

***Maces.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage,
or 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage if the swarm
has half of its hit points or fewer.

***Heavy Crossbow Barrage.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 11
(2d10) piercing damage, or 5 (1d10) piercing
damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or
fewer.
