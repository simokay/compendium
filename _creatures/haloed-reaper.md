***Blinding Blades.*** The reaper's weapon attacks are
magical. When the reaper hits with any weapon, the
weapon deals an extra 3d8 necrotic damage and if the
target is a creature it must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the
reaper's next turn (included in the attack).

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The reaper's spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 16). The seraph can innately
cast the following spells, requiring only verbal
components.

* At will: <i>detect evil and good, hunter's mark </i>(at 5th level)<i>, invisibility </i>(self only)

* 2/day each: <i>destructive wave </i>(necrotic only), <i>dimension door</i>

* 1/day each: <i>disintegrate, flesh to stone</i>

***Magic Resistance.*** The reaper has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The reaper makes two melee attacks, only
one of which can be a decaying touch.

***Grand Scythe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach
10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d12 + 7) slashing damage
plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage and if the target is a
creature it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution
saving throw or become blinded until the reaper's next
turn

***Cleaving Swipe.*** The reaper spins its scythe in an arcing
slash. Make an attack against each enemy within reach
of the reaper's grand scythe, making a separate attack
roll against each target.

***Reap.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 40 necrotic damage. If the target is a
creature that has fewer than 20 hit points after this
attack, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or immediately die. If the creature dies as a
result of this attack, the reaper regains 40 hit points.

***Decaying Touch (3/Day).*** Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 49 (10d8 + 4) necrotic
damage.

***Binding Halo (Recharge 5-6).*** The reaper extends its
scythe and launches a black halo at two creatures it can
see within 120 feet. These creatures must succeed on
a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.
A restrained creature takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage
at the start of its turn and can make a DC 18 Strength
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
