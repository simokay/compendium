***Multifaceted Perspective.*** Because of their large
and multifaceted eyes, coh-leop are hard to surprise.
The coh-leop has advantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight and on all initiative rolls.

***Spider Climb.*** The coh-leop can climb difficult
surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without
needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The coh-leop makes two claw attacks.

***Macuahuitl.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 +2) slashing damage.
When weapon damage is rolled for a savage weapon,
any damage result of 1 is treated as though it was a 2.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target, Hit: 5 (2d4) slashing damage.

### Reactions

***Stink.*** When the coh-leop is the target of an opportunity
attack it can use its reaction to spray a cloud
of noxious gas from its abdomen. Each creature
within 5 ft. must make a DC 12 Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save the attack is lost and the
creature cannot make opportunity attacks against
the coh-leop until the start of its next turn.
