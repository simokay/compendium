***Land's Stride.*** Moving through nonmagical difficult
terrain does not cost the heir extra movement.

***Natural Recovery (1/Day).*** When the heir finishes a
short rest, it can regain up to 3 total expended spell
slots.

***Spellcasting.*** The heir is a 6th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6
to hit with spell attacks). The heir has the following
druid spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>create bonfire, druidcraft, shillelagh, thorn whip</i>

***Wild Shape - Dire Wolf (2/Day).*** As a bonus action,

hours. When the wolf is reduced to 0 hit points, the
druid reverts to its normal form, with any excess
damage carrying over to the druid's hit points.
