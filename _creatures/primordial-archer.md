***Elemental Arrows.*** Whenever the archer draws an
arrow from its quiver, the archer can imbue it with
elemental magics, imbuing the arrow with special
properties depending on the element chosen:

* Fire – The arrow deals an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage.
* Ice – Any creature hit by this arrow takes an additional 3 (1d6) cold damage and has its movement speed reduced by 10 feet on its next turn.
* Poison – Any creature hit by this arrow must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn.
* Lightning – Any creature hit by this arrow takes an additional 3 (1d6) lightning damage and can’t use reactions until its next turn.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The archer uses its overcharged shot if
able, then makes two attacks with its longbow.

***Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range
150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing
damage.

***Overcharged Shot (Recharge 5-6).*** The next arrow
the archer fires this turn gains the effects of two
elemental arrows instead of one.
