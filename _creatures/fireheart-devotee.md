***Spellcasting.*** The devotee is a 6th-level spellcaster.
Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The devotee has the
following cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, light, spare the dying

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>burning hands, faerie fire, guiding bolt, sanctuary</i>

* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>aid, flaming sphere, scorching ray, spiritual weapon</i>

* 3rd level (3 slots): <i>clairvoyance, daylight, fireball, mass healing word</i>

***Radiance of the Dawn (2/Short Rest).*** The devotee
raises its holy symbol and dispels any magical
darkness within 30 feet. Additionally, each creature
hostile to the devotee must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (2d10 + 6)
radiant damage on a failed saving throw, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

***Warding Flame (4/Day).*** When the devotee or one of
its allies is attacked by a creature it can see within
30 feet, the devotee can use its reaction to give
that creature disadvantage on the attack. Creatures
immune to the blinded condition are not affected
by this ability.
