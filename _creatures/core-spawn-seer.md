***Earth Glide.*** The seer can traverse through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the seer doesn’t disturb the material it moves through.

***Magic Resistance.*** The seer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The seer uses Fission Staff twice, Psychedelic Orb twice, or each one once.

***Fission Staff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (1d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage, and the target is knocked prone.

***Psychedelic Orb.*** The seer hurls a glimmering orb at one creature it can see within 120 of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take 27 (5d10) psychic damage and suffer a random condition until the start of the seer’s next turn. Roll a d6 for the condition:
* (1–2) blinded
* (3–4) frightened
* (5–6) stunned.

### Reactions

***Fuse Damage.*** When the seer is hit by an attack, it takes only half of the triggering damage. The first time the seer hits with a melee attack on its next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 radiant damage.
