***Infernal Blade.*** The enforcer has an infernal blade
bound to it. This weapon ignores all resistances and
deals an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage with each attack
(included in the attack). In addition, while the
enforcer is wielding this blade, it cannot be
disarmed.

***Spellcasting.*** The enforcer is a 6th-level spellcaster.
Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It regains these
expended spellslots when it finishes a short or long
rest. The enforcer has the following warlock spells
prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>blade ward, eldritch blast, mage hand</i>

* 1st-3rd level (3 3rd-level slots): <i>armor of Agathys, crown of madness, fear, hellish rebuke, hex, spider climb</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The enforcer makes two attacks with its
felblade and one with its felstrike.

***Felblade.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage
plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Felstrike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning
damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Infernal Onslaught (3/Short Rest).*** The enforcer
performs a swift series of punches to launch bursts
of flame at up to four targets within 60 feet. Each
of those creatures must make a DC 16 Dexterity
saving throw, saving 17 (5d6) fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
save.
