***Flyby.*** The angel doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

***Magic Resistance.*** The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The angel makes two melee attacks. It also uses Battlefield Inspiration.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage. If the target is within 5 feet of any of the angel’s allies, the target takes an extra 2 (1d4) radiant damage.

***Battlefield Inspiration.*** The angel chooses up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Until the end of the angel’s next turn, each target can add a d4 to its attack rolls and saving throws.
