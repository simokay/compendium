***Hold Breath.*** The clawfish can hold their breath for
15 minutes.

### Actions

***Signature Attack (Bite).*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 plus PB to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 plus PB piercing damage.

***1st Level: Overwhelming Attack (2 Ferocity).*** The clawfish
makes a signature attack. On a hit, the attack deals an extra
PB lightning damage, and the target can’t take reactions until
the start of the clawfish’s next turn.

***3rd Level: Coiling Claws (5 Ferocity).*** The clawfish makes a
signature attack against a Medium or smaller creature. On a hit,
the target is grappled (escape DC 10 plus PB). Until this grapple
ends, the target is restrained and the clawfish can’t make a
signature attack against another target.

***5th Level: Lightning Bomb (8 Ferocity).*** Each creature within
10 feet of the clawfish must make a DC 10 plus PB Dexterity
saving throw, taking PBd8 lightning damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

***Lightning Retaliation (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the clawfish or their caregiver is attacked by a
creature the clawfish can see within 5 feet of them, the clawfish
shocks the attacker. The attacker must make a DC 10 plus PB
Dexterity saving throw, taking PBd6 lightning damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
