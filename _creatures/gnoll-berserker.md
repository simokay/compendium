***Rage (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, the gnoll can enter a rage at the start of its turn. The rage lasts for 1 minute or until the gnoll is incapacitated. While raging, the gnoll gains the following benefits:
* The gnoll has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* When it makes a melee weapon attack, the gnoll gains a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* The gnoll has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* The gnoll gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to make one weapon attack or move up to its speed towards a hostile target it can see.

***Rampage.*** When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gnoll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its boneclaws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, or 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage while raging.

***Boneclaws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage while raging.
