***Cowardly.*** Whenever an ally dies within 60 feet of
the goblin that the goblin can see, it must succeed
on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or use its
reaction to run its movement speed away from the
creature that dealt the lethal blow. On a result of 5
or lower, the goblin passes out from the fear for
1d4 minutes.

***Nimble Escape.*** The goblin can take the Disengage
or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its
turns.
