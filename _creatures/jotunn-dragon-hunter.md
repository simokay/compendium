***Blizzard Stalker.*** The jötunn's vision and hearing are
unimpeded by inclement weather such as wind,
snow, and fog, and it has advantage on all Dexterity
(Stealth) checks it makes in such conditions.

***Ice Walk.*** The jötunn can move across and climb icy
surfaces without needing to make an ability check.
Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or
snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

***Ice Weapons.*** Once on each of its turns, the jötunn
can form a weapon of solid ice in its empty hand (no
action required). This weapon can be either a javelin
or a lance, either of which counts as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to
nonmagical attacks. The weapon lasts indefinitely, as
long as it remains in sub-freezing temperatures.

***Innate Spellcasting (1/Day).*** The jötunn can innately
cast <i>ice storm</i>, requiring no material components.
Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save
DC 15).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The jötunn makes two attacks with its
battleaxe.

***Battleaxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach
15 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (3d12 + 7) slashing
damage, or 33 (4d12 + 7) slashing damage if
wielded with two hands.

***Ice Lance.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach
15 ft., one target. Hit: 52 (10d8 + 7) piercing
damage plus 22 (5d8) cold damage.
