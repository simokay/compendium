***Amphibious.*** The needler can breathe air and water.

***Sniper.*** If the needler misses with a ranged weapon attack
while they are hidden, they remain hidden. Additionally, if the
needler makes a ranged weapon attack with advantage and
hits, the attack deals an extra 3 (1d6) damage.

***Toxiferous.*** When a creature hits the needler with a melee
attack while within 5 feet of them or touches the needler,
that creature takes 2 (1d4) poison damage.

### Actions

***Poison Shortsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6)
poison damage.

***Blowgun.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 25/100 ft.,
one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned
for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). While poisoned in this
way, the target takes 14 (4d6) poison damage at the start of
each of their turns.

### Bonus Actions

***Hop and Hide.*** The needler jumps a number of feet up
to their walking speed, then takes the Hide action.
