***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature’s
space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through
any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm
can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

### Actions

***Dagger.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 0
ft., one target in the swarm’s space. Hit: 10 (4d4)
piercing damage, or 5 (2d4) piercing damage if the
swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
