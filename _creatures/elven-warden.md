***Fey Ancestry.*** The elven warden has advantage on
saving throws against being charmed, and magic
canâ€™t put them to sleep.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The elven warden makes three melee
attacks: two with their longsword and one with
their dagger. Or the warden makes two ranged attacks
with their daggers.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 +2) slashing damage,
or 7 (1d10 +2) slashing damage if used with both
hands.

***Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 +3) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** The elven warden adds 2 to its AC against
one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the
elven warden must see the attacker and be wielding
a melee weapon.
