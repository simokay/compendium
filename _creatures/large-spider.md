***Spider Climb.*** The large spider can climb difficult
surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without
needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider
knows the exact location of any creature in contact
with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions
caused by webbing.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4+2) piercing damage, and
the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage. If
the target is reduced to 0 hit points, the target is
stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining
hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned this
way.
