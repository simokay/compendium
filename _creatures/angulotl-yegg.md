***Amphibious.*** The angulotl yegg can breathe air and water.

***Signature Attack (Poison Knife).*** Melee or Ranged Weapon
Attack: +3 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft.,
one target. Hit: 1d4 plus PB piercing damage plus 7 (2d6)
poison damage. Beginning at 7th level, the yegg can make
this attack twice, instead of once, when they take the Attack
action on their turn.

### Features

***3rd Level: Death from Above! (3/Day).*** As a bonus action,
the yegg jumps up to their walking speed without provoking
opportunity attacks. If they leap over an enemy during this
jump, the yegg can make a signature attack with advantage
against that enemy. On a hit, this attack deals an extra PB
piercing damage.

***5th Level: Lay Low (3/Day).*** When the yegg hits a creature
with a signature attack while hidden, the yegg can use their
reaction to remain hidden.

***7th Level: Excoriating Acid (3/Day).*** As an action, the yegg
throws a flask of acid at a point they can see within 20 feet of
them. The flask shatters, and each creature within 10 feet of
that point must make a DC 10 plus PB Dexterity saving throw,
taking PBd10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
