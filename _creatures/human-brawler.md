***Exploit Opening (3/Day).*** When the brawler makes an
attack, they have advantage on the attack roll.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The brawler makes two attacks using Grab,
Haymaker, or both.

***Grab.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
Medium or smaller creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning
damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this
grapple ends, the brawler canâ€™t grab another creature.

***Haymaker.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, or
10 (3d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage against a grappled target.

***Throw.*** The brawler throws one Medium or smaller creature
they are grappling or object they are holding up to 30 feet
horizontally. If the thrown target is a creature, they fall prone
after this throw. If the thrown target would enter the space
of a creature or solid object that is no more than one size
smaller than it, the thrown target collides with it and stops in
the nearest unoccupied space, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning
damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. A Large or smaller
creature hit by this thrown target must succeed on a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw or take the same amount of damage
and fall prone.

### Reactions

***Meat Shield.*** When the brawler is grappling a target and is
hit by a ranged attack made by another creature the brawler
can see, the brawler gains a +2 bonus to AC against the
triggering attack. If this bonus causes the attack to miss the
brawler, it hits the grappled target instead.
