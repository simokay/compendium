***Disabling Strikes.*** The guardian's weapons are magical.
When the guardian hits with any weapon, the weapon
deals an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and the target
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or
the next weapon or spell attack it makes is made at
disadvantage (included in the attack).

***Magic Resistance.*** The guardian has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The guardian makes three melee attacks:
two with its flail and one with its shield crush.

***Flail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 9
(2d8) necrotic damage and the target must succeed on
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or the next weapon
or spell attack it makes is made at disadvantage.

***Shield Crush.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage
and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength
saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet and knocked
prone.

***Rapid Assault (Recharge 5-6).*** The guardian makes four
flail attacks against a single target with disadvantage.

### Reactions

***Shield Wall (2/Day).*** The guardian raises its shield and
projects an ethereal barrier of energy against a ranged
spell or weapon attack that it can see. That attack deals
no damage. This ability does not work on spells of 5th
level or higher.
