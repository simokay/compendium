***Bonded Weapon.*** The spellblade has a magical bond
with its weapon. Unless incapacitated, the
spellblade cannot be disarmed and can summon its
weapon as a bonus action as long as it is on the
same plane of existence.

***Second Wind (1/Short Rest).*** As a bonus action, the
spellblade can regain 1d10 + 6 hit points.

***Spellcasting.*** The spellblade is a 6th-level spellcaster.
Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC
13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The spellblade has
the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>fire bolt, shocking grasp</i>

* 1st level (3 slots): <i>detect magic, feather fall, jump, shield</i>

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spellblade makes two attacks with
its longsword, or casts a cantrip and makes a
longsword attack.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage,
or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two
hands.

***Action Surge (1/Short Rest).*** The spellblade makes
four longsword attacks.

### Reactions

***Protective Fighting.*** When a creature the spellblade
can see attacks an ally within 5 feet of the
spellblade, it can use its reaction to impose
disadvantage on that attack roll as long as the
spellblade is wielding a shield.
