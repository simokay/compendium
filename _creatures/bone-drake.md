***Pack Tactics.*** The bone drake has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the drake's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bone drake makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

***Bite.*** Melee weapon attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  Hit: 7 (1d8+3)
piercing damage.

***Tail.*** Melee weapon attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  Hit: 6 (1d6+3)
bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or
become poisoned for 1 minute.  The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  A creature poisoned in this way has their
speed halved and cannot take reactions.
