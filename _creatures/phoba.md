***Cunning Action.*** On each of its turns, the thief can
use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage,
Hide, or Use an Object action, make a Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check, or use thieves’ tools to
disarm a trap or open a lock.

***Petrifying Gaze.*** When a creature that can see Phoba’s
eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of her, she can
force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw
if she isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If
the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is
instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails
the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained.
The restrained creature must repeat the saving
throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified
on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The
petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the
greater restoration spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid
the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature
does so, it can’t see Phoba until the start of its next turn,
when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at
Phoba in the meantime, it must immediately make the
save. If Phoba sees herself reflected on a polished surface
within 30 feet of her and in an area of bright light,
she is, due to her curse, affected by her own gaze.

***Sneak Attack (1/turn).*** Phoba deals an extra 7
(2d6) damage when she hits a target with a weapon
attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or
when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of her
that isn’t incapacitated and she doesn’t have disadvantage
on the attack roll.

***Special Equipment.*** Phoba wears a <i>ring of invisibility</i>
and carries a <i>portable hole</i>.
