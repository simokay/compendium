***Natural Resilience.*** A life away from the pleasures of
society has made the soldier tougher than an
ordinary individual. It has advantage on Constitution
and Strength saving throws.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The soldier makes two glaive attacks.

***Glaive.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10
ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage.

***Javelin.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range
30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing
damage.

### Reactions

***Readied Strike.*** Whenever a creature enters the
reach of the soldier's glaive, the soldier can
immediately make a glaive attack against that
creature at disadvantage.
