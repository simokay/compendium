***Horrid Gnashing.*** The nullifier’s mouths gnash incoherently while it can see any enemies. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the nullifier and can hear it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature rolls a d8 to determine what it does during the current turn:

* 1–4: The creature is stunned until the end of the turn.

* 5–6: The creature is frightened until the end of the turn and uses its movement to get as far as possible from the nullifier.

* 7–8: The creature doesn’t move, and it uses its action to make one melee attack against a random creature (other than itself) if one is within reach. It otherwise does nothing.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The nullifier’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>counterspell </i>(see “Reactions” below)<i>, detect magic, dispel magic, see invisibility</i>

* 1/day: <i>antimagic field</i>

***Magic Resistance.*** The nullifier has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The nullifier makes three attacks: one with its bites and two with its claws.

***Bites.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 17 (2d12 + 4) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) force damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) force damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16) if it’s a creature. The nullifier has two claws, each of which can grapple one creature.

### Reactions

***Counterspell.*** The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.
