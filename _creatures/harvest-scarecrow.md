***False Appearance.*** While the harvest scarecrow
remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an
ordinary, inanimate scarecrow.

***Dust of the Field.*** Whenever a creature successfully
makes a melee attack against the harvest scarecrow,
the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving
throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The harvest scarecrow makes two
attacks with its old tools.

***Old Tools.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage. If
the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 11
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one
hour.

***Hay Fever.*** The harvest scarecrow targets one
creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target
must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw
or spend its next action coughing and sneezing
uncontrollably. Creatures that don’t need to breathe
automatically succeed on this saving throw.
