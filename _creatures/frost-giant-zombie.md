***Numbing Aura.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature canâ€™t make more than one attack, or take a bonus action on that turn.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is fire, radiant, or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The zombie makes two weapon attacks.

***Greataxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (3d12 + 6) slashing damage.

***Hurl Rock.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

***Freezing Stare.*** The zombie targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 35 (10d6) cold damage and be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
