***Slamming Charge.*** If the goblin moves at least 15
feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with
a battleaxe attack on the same turn, that target
must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or
be knocked prone.

***Relentless Bloodlust.*** As long as the goblin has 20
hit points or fewer, it makes its first attack on each
turn with advantage and has resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from
nonmagical weapons.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The goblin makes two attacks with its
battleaxe.

***Battleaxe.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or
8 (1d10 +3) slashing damage if used with two
hands.

***Handaxe.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to
hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 3)
slashing damage.
