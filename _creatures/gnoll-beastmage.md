***Bestial Affinity.*** The gnoll can comprehend and verbally
communicate with beasts, and it has advantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** While the gnoll is in a beast form, it has
advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least
one of the gnoll's allies is within 5 feet of the creature
and the ally isn't incapacitated.

***Rampage.*** When the gnoll reduces a creature to O hit
points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll can
take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and
make a bite attack.

***Shapechanger.*** The gnoll can use its action to polymorph
into a giant hyena, a hyena, a jackal, a rat, or a vulture, or
back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size
and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it
is wearing or carrying is transformed along with it. It
reverts to its true form if it dies.

***Spellcasting.*** The gnoll is a 4th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to
hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells
prepared.
* Cantrips (at-will): <i>druidcraft, guidance, resistance</i>
* lst level (4 slots): <i>animal friendship, cure wounds</i>
* 2nd level (3 slots): <i>animal messenger, locate animals or plants, pass without trace</i>
