***Amphibious.*** The seer can breathe air and water.

***Third Eye.*** Creatures within 30 feet of the seer can’t hide from
the seer. Creatures who can’t be targeted by divination magic
are immune to this effect.

***Toxiferous.*** When a creature hits the seer with a melee attack
while within 5 feet of them or touches the seer, that creature
takes 2 (1d4) poison damage.

### Actions

***Acid Grasp.*** Melee Spell Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 14 (4d6) acid damage. If the target is a creature
and they attack the seer before the start of the seer’s next turn,
the target takes 14 (4d6) acid damage.

***Refulgent Beam.*** The seer fires two magical beams of radiant
energy, each beam targeting a creature the seer can see within
120 feet of them. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or take 13 (3d8) radiant damage and shed
dim light in a 10-foot radius for 1 minute (save ends at end
of turn). While shedding light in this way, attack rolls against
the target have advantage, the target can’t benefit from being
invisible, and they can’t take the Hide action.

***Noxious Bubble (1/Day).*** The seer creates a 5-foot-radius
sphere filled with toxic gas in an unoccupied space they can
see within 60 feet of them. If undisturbed, this bubble lasts
for 1 minute then dissipates harmlessly. If a creature attacks
the bubble, touches it, enters its space, or otherwise disturbs
it, the bubble bursts, and each creature within 15 feet of it
must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8)
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

***Psychedelic Drone (1/Day).*** Each enemy within 60 feet of the
seer who can hear them must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage and be dazed
for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).

### Bonus Actions

***Hop.*** The seer jumps a number of feet up to their
walking speed.
