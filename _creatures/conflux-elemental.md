***Illumination.*** The elemental sheds bright light in a 50-
foot radius and dim light for an additional 50 feet.

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the elemental fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Mutable Form.*** The elemental can move through a space
as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Tempest Barrier.*** A creature that touches the elemental
or hits it with a melee or ranged attack while within 15
feet of it takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage.

### Actions

***Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 3
(1d6) cold damage, 3 (1d6) fire damage, and 3 (1d6)
lightning damage.

***Boulder Barrage (Recharge 5-6).*** The elemental launches
a barrage of boulders at a point it can see within 60
feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27
(5d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails
this save by 10 or more is also knocked prone.

***Icy Pulse (Recharge 5-6).*** The elemental sends out a
pulse of ice around its body. Each creature within 20
feet of the elemental must make a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) cold damage and having
its speed reduced by 10 feet on its next turn on a failed
save, or half as much damage and not slowed on a
successful one. A creature that fails this save by 10 or
more has a speed of 0 on its next turn instead.

***Flame Blades (Recharge 5-6).*** The elemental unleashes 3
blades of fire in separate 5-foot wide, 90-foot long
lines. Each creature within one of these lines must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6)
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one.

***Summon Elemental Obelisks (1/Day).*** The elemental
summons 3 immobile obelisks in unoccupied spaces
within 60 feet. These obelisks are medium objects
with AC 15 and 20 hit points. Each of these have a
small orb floating above them charged with elemental
power – one cold, one fire, and one lightning. Until
they are destroyed or the elemental killed, on initiative
count 20 (losing initiative ties), these orbs perform a
ranged spell attack against a creature within 60 feet
with a +7 bonus to hit. On a hit, that creature takes 10
(3d6) damage of the corresponding element type.

### Legendary Actions

The elemental can take 2 legendary actions, choosing
from the options below. Only one legendary action can
be used at a time and only at the end of another
creature’s turn. The elemental regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.

***Touch.*** The elemental makes a touch attack.

***Elemental Onslaught (2 actions).*** The elemental uses its
boulder barrage, icy pulse, or flame blades.
