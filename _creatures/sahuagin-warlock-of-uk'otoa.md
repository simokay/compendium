***Blood Frenzy.*** The warlock has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn’t have all its hit points.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The warlock’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: <i>eldritch blast, minor illusion</i>

* 1/day each: <i>armor of Agathys, arms of Hadar, counterspell, crown of madness, invisibility, hunger of Hadar.</i>

***Limited Amphibiousness.*** The warlock can breathe air and water, but it needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.

***Shark Telepathy.*** The warlock can magically command any shark within 120 feet of it, using a limited telepathy.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The warlock makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its Sword of Fathoms.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

***Sword of Fathoms.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or begin choking. The choking creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn, when the effect ends on it.

***Eldritch Blast (Cantrip).*** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d10) force damage.
