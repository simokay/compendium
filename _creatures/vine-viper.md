***Floral Camouflage.*** While the viper remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary
tree vine.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one creature. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and
the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw against being magically petrified. On a
failed save, the creature begins to turn to wood and
is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the
end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends.
On a failure, the create is petrified for the next 8
hours.

***Nutrient Absorption.*** The viper drives its tail into a
tree or petrified creature within 5 feet, draining
resources from the target to heal itself. The target
takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage and the snake
restores hit points equal to the amount of necrotic
damage dealt.
