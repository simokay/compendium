***Blubber.*** The walrutte has advantage on any saving
throw it makes against an effect that would deal cold
damage.

***Hold Breath.*** The walrutte can hold its breath for 1 hour.

***Ice Walk.*** The walrutte can move across icy surfaces
without needing to make an ability check. Additionally,
difficult terrain due to ice or snow doesn't cost it extra
movement.

***Swimming Leap.*** If the walrutte swims at least 10 feet in
a straight line before breaching the surface of the
water, its long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump
is up to 15 feet. As part of this movement, the walrutte
can break through up to 5 feet of solid ice.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The walrutte makes two gore attacks.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage.

***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Deadly Breach.*** If the walrutte jumps at least 15 feet as
part of its movement, it can then use this action to land
upright in a space that contains one or more other
creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a
DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's
choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4)
bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage. On a
successful save, the creature takes only half the
damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out
of the walrutte's space into an unoccupied space of the
creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within
range, the creature instead falls prone in the walrutte's
space.
