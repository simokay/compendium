***Martial Advantage.*** Once per turn, the hobgoblin
can deal an extra 10 (3d6) damage to a creature it hits
with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet
of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hobgoblin makes two melee
weapon attacks.

***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit,
reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 6 (1d8 +2) piercing damage
is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Fiery Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit,
range 50/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing
damage and 2 (1d4) fire damage. If the target is a creature
or a flammable object, it ignites and takes 2 (1d4)
fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature
can end this damage by using its action to make a DC
10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

***Alchemist’s Fire.*** Improvised Weapon Attack: +2
to hit, range 20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire
damage. The target takes 2 (1d4) fire damage at the
start of each of its turns. A creature can end this
damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity
check to extinguish the flames.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special
command or warning whenever a nonhostile
creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an
attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add
a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand
the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only
one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the
hobgoblin is incapacitated.
