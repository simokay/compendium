***Interdimensional Movement.*** A quelaunt can innately cast <i>misty step</i> as a bonus action once per round.

***Alien Mind.*** The quelauntâ€™s thoughts are unreadable, and any creature attempting
to mentally interact with it must make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) psychic damage.

***Aura of Fear.*** The quelaunt mentally assaults the mind of all hostile creatures it can see, filling their heads with insane mutterings and preying upon their fears and negative emotions.  If a creature starts its turn within 20 ft. of the quelaunt, it must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.  The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.  Creatures who succeed on the saving throw are immune to this effect for 24 hours. 

***Legendary Resistance (2/day).*** If the quelaunt fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The quelaunt's innate spellcasting ability is 
Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks).  It can innately cast the following spells, 
requiring no components:

* At will: <i>misty step</i>

* 1/day each: <i>fear, fly, sleep</i> (cast at 5th level)

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The quelaunt makes three claw attacks.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack. +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) 
slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.

***Maddening Whispers.*** The quelaunt telepathically assaults a target it can see within 60 ft. 
The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 33 (6d10) psychic damage and 
be stunned until the end of the target's next turn.

### Reactions

***Mist Form.*** Upon taking damage from an attack, the quelaunt's body partially dissolves into smoke and mist 
before reforming again.  The quelaunt gains resistance to all damage from the triggering attack.
