***Corrupted Angelic Weapons.*** The sentinel's weapons
are magical. When the sentinel hits with any
weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 necrotic
damage (included in the attack).

***Magic Resistance.*** The sentinel has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical
effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sentinel makes two longbow
attacks.

***Longbow.*** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range
150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing
damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.

***Retreating Shot (Recharge 4-6).*** The sentinel leaps
back 50 feet without provoking attacks of
opportunity, then makes two shots against a single
target with its longbow. The first of these attacks is
made with advantage.

***Decaying Touch (3/Day).*** Melee Spell Attack: +7 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (6d8 + 3)
necrotic damage.

***Crash of Arrows (1/Day).*** The sentinel creates a 30
foot diameter runic circle centered on a location it
can see within 120 feet. Whenever a creature
enters this area for the first time on a turn or ends
its turn in this area, conjured arrows rain down
upon them. That creature must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw, taking 32 (7d8) piercing
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one.
