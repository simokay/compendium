following benefits:
* Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving
throws
* Melee weapon attacks deal an addition 2 damage.
* The zealot gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage.

***Spellcasting.*** The zealot is a 6th-level spellcaster. Its

hit with spell attacks). The zealot has the following
cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, sacred flame

Large or smaller creature, it can also push it up to 10
feet away from it.

damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
