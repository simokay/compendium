***Blazing Feathers.*** The feathers that cover the
phoenix's body are constantly ablaze. These flames
shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light
for an additional 10 feet. Additionally, a creature
that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee
attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) fire
damage.

***Flyby.*** The phoenix doesn't provoke attacks of
opportunity when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

***Keen Sight.*** The phoenix has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The phoenix makes two attacks: one
with its beak and one with its talons.

***Beak.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 2
(1d4) fire damage.

***Talons.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage plus 2
(1d4) fire damage.
