***Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the shadowghast must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to this Stench for 24 hours.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the shadowghast can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shadowghast makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
