***Floral Camouflage.*** While the moose remains
motionless and is lying down, it is indistinguishable
from a large log covered in mushrooms.

***Poisonous Exterior.*** The mushrooms that coat the
moose's body are poisonous and deadly to most
other creatures. A creature that touches the moose
or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of
it takes 5 (1d10) poison damage.

***Rapid Regrowth.*** The mushroom moose has
unnatural regenerative capabilities. At the
beginning of each of the moose's turns, as long as
it is in direct sunlight and it has at least 1 hit point,
it regains 4 (1d8) hit points.

### Actions

***Ram.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage
plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
