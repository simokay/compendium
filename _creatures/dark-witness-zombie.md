***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces a dark witness
zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution
saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the
damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or a
critical hit. On a success, the dark witness zombie
drops to 1 hit point instead.

### Actions

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
Hit: 4 (1d8) piercing damage.

***Aberrant Gaze.*** The dark witness zombie targets a
creature it can see within 120 ft. An eye at the end
of one of its tentacle arms uses one of the following
effects on the target.
* **Fear Gaze.** The target creature must succeed on
a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of
the dark witness for 1 minute. The target can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on a success.
* **Shocking Gaze.** The target creature must succeed
on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 28
(8d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as
much on a successful one.
