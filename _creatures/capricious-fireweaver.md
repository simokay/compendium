***Spellcasting.*** The flameweaver is a 3th-level
spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell
save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The
flameweaver has the following sorcerer spells
prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): <i>firebolt, prestidigitation, shocking grasp</i>

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>burning hands, detect magic, mage armor, magic missile</i>

* 2nd level (2 slots): <i>flaming sphere, scorching ray, suggestion</i>

***Sorcery Points.*** The flameweaver has 3 sorcery
points. It can spend 1 or more sorcery points as a
bonus action to gain one of the following benefits:
* Quickened Spell. When the sorcerer casts a spell
that has a casting time of an action, it can spend
2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1
bonus action instead.
* Subtle Spell. When the sorcerer casts a spell, it
can spend 1 sorcery point to cast the spell
without any somatic or verbal components.

***Wild Magic.*** When the fireweaver casts a spell of 1st
level or higher, roll a d10. On a result of 1, roll on the
Wild Magic Surge table (PHB Pg. 104) immediately
after the spell is cast to create a random effect.

### Actions

reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4
(1d4 + 2) piercing damage.
