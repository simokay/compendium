***Divine Smite.*** When the hunter hits with a melee
weapon attack, it can expend a spell slot to deal an
addition 9 (2d8) radiant damage, in addition to the
weapon's damage. This damage increases by 1d8
radiant damage per spell slot level above 1st.

***Great Weapon Fighting Style.*** When the hunter rolls a
1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack with its pike, it
can reroll that die and take the second result.

***Spellcasting.*** The hunter is a 6th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The hunter has the
following paladin spells prepared:

* 1st level (4 slots): <i>bane, detect magic, hunter's mark, shield of faith</i>

* 2nd level (2 slots): <i>hold person, magic weapon, misty step</i>

***Vow of Enmity (1/Day).*** As a bonus action, the
hunter utters a vow against a creature it can see
within 10 feet. The hunter has advantage on attack
rolls against that creature for 1 minute or until the
creature falls to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hunter makes two attacks with its
pike.

***Pike.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage.

***Lay on Hands (2/Day).*** The hunter touches a creature
and restores 15 hit points to it.

### Reactions

***Spell Slash.*** When a creature within 10 feet of the
hunter casts a spell, it can use its reaction to make
a weapon attack against that creature. If that
creature is concentrating on a spell, it has
disadvantage on the saving throw to maintain its
concentration.
