***Magic Resistance.*** The absorber has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Pounce.*** If the absorber moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits its claws attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the absorber can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The absorber makes three attacks: one with its bite or Mind Bolt and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) force damage.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) force damage.

***Mind Bolt.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 (4d10) psychic damage.

### Reactions

***Tail Ray.*** When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
