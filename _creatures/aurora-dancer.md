***Blizzard Stalker.*** The dancer's vision and hearing are
unimpeded by inclement weather such as wind, snow,
and fog, and it has advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth)
checks it makes in such conditions.

***Reactive.*** The dancer can take an take one reaction on
every turn in a combat.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dancer makes three attacks with its
scimitar.

***Frozen Scimitar.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.

***Cutting Wind.*** The dancer swings its blade in a wide
horizontal arc, slicing out at each creature in a 15-foot
square within 5 feet of the dancer. Each creature in the
area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
or take 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) cold
damage.

### Reactions

***Blade Dance.*** When a creature the dancer can see moves
while within 10 feet of it, the dancer can move up to
15 feet in a straight line to an unoccupied space it can
see. Opportunity attacks triggered by this movement
due to the dancer leaving another creature's reach are
made with disadvantage.
