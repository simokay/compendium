runes granted by a runespeaker that provide it with
additional strength. The soldier gains one of the
following runic bonuses:
* Rune of Fortitude – The soldier's AC is increased
to 18. In addition, as long as the soldier has at
least 1 hit point, it regenerates 3 hit points at the
start of its turns.
* Rune of Perception – The soldier has advantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks and can see
invisible creatures.
* Rune of Strength – The soldier's longsword
attacks deal an additional 2 slashing damage and
it has advantage on Strength-based checks and
saving throws.

***Runic Weapon.*** The soldier's longsword is imbued
with powerful arcane runes, causing attacks with
that weapon to deal an additional 4 (1d8) force
damage (included in the attack).
