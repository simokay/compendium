***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's
space and vice versa, and the swarm can move
through any opening large enough for a Medium
bandit. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain
temporary hit points.

### Actions

***Scimitars.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage,
or 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage if the swarm has
half of its hit points or fewer.
