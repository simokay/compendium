against being frightened.

***Halfling Nimbleness.*** Bingley can move through
the space of a Medium or larger creature.
Keen Hearing and Smell. Bingley has advantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or
smell.

***Lucky.*** When Bingley rolls a 1 on an attack roll, ability
check, or saving throw, he can reroll the die and
must use the new roll.

***Shapechanger.*** Bingley can use its action to polymorph
into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf,
or back into his true form, which is humanoid. His
statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each
form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn’t
transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
