***Magic Resistance.*** The emissary has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The emissary makes three talons attacks.

***Talons.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.

***Alluring Thrum (Recharges 5—6).*** The emissary emits a dreadful yet alluring hum. Each creature within 20 feet of the emissary that can hear it and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Crystal Spores (Recharge 6).*** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic crystalline spores extends out from the emissary. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature takes 11 (2d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
