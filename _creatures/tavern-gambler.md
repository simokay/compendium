***Cunning Action.*** As a bonus action, the gambler can
take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

***Lucky Charm.*** When the gambler rolls a natural 1 for
an attack roll or skill check, it can reroll and take the
second result instead. The gambler also has
advantage on skill checks for dice and card games.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The gambler deals an extra
14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a
weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll,
or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the
gambler that isn't incapacitated and the gambler
doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gambler makes two attacks with its
dagger.

***Dagger.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit,
reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5
(1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

### Reactions

***Uncanny Dodge (1/Turn).*** The gambler halves the
damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The
gambler must be able to see the attacker.
