***Acid Burst.*** When the tadpole is reduced to 0 hit points,
their body pops, spraying acid around them. Each creature
within 5 feet of the tadpole takes 1 acid damage.

***Amphibious.*** The tadpole can breathe air and water.

***Minion.*** If the tadpole takes damage from an attack or as the
result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to
0. If the tadpole takes damage from another effect, they die
if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum;
otherwise they take no damage.

***Noxious Skin.*** When a creature starts their turn within 5 feet
of three or more tadpoles, that creature must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of
their next turn. The DC for this saving throw equals 10 plus
the number of tadpoles within 5 feet of the creature.

### Actions

5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage.
