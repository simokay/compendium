<p><em>5th-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br>
<strong>Components:</strong> V<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 30 days</p>
<p>You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide.</p>
<p>If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.</p>
<p>You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or Wish spell also ends it.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.</p>
