_9th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You select a creature within range, and nine small silvery orbs spring into being, hovering around the creature and granting it strong magical protection. On your turn, as an action or bonus action (your choice), you can transfer the orbs (and their protection) to another creature within range.

When the protected creature makes a saving throw, or when it's targeted by a spell attack, it can expend one of the orbs as a reaction to gain advantage on the saving throw or impose dis-advantage on the spell attack. If the protected creature chooses, it can instead use its reaction to expend two of the orbs, automatically causing the spell attack to miss or the saving throw to succeed. This choice can be made after the spell attack of saving throw is rolled, but before the DM declares whether the roll hit, missed, succeeded, or failed. Expended orbs fade away. Once all nine orbs are gone, the spell ends.

This spell only protects the creature that currently has the orbs hovering around it. Other targets caught in the spell's area are affected normally.
