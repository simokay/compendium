_1st-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** S 
**Duration:** 1 round

You conceal your arcane attack, manipulating your foe into believing the attack came from your ally and focusing on them obsessively. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 psychic damage, and you choose one willing ally within 30 feet of both you and the target. That ally marks the target until the end of your next turn. While a target marked with this spell in within 5 feet of the ally that marked it, it has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target that ally. this spell ends early if the marking ally dies or is incapacitated, or if the target marked with this spell is marked by a creature besides the ally you choose.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
