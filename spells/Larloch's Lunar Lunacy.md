_7th-level illusion_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A full moon swims into view, shining even through solid stone; but those who view it feel their minds recoil at its wrongness, a vision of the Far Realms, with crater-eyes and fracture lines writhing to reveal continent-sized tentacles. Each creature other than you within range must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature that can't see, that has an Intelligence score of 2 or lower, or that is a aberration is unaffected by this spell. A target takes 6d12 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Also, a creature that fails its saving throw struggles to maintain its grip on reality. For the duration, it's frightened of the illusory moon, can't take reactions or bonus actions, and has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. An affected target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, that initial psychic damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 7th.
