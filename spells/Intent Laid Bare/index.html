<p><em>Divination cantrip</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> 5 feet
<strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a weapon)
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round</p>
<p>As part of the action used to case the spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. You can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of this attack.</p>
<p>On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and its moment of pain gives you an opening to search your target's mind, sensing its immediate intentions. Until the spell ends at the start of your net turn, the target can't take the Disengage action, and it can't benefit from advantage on melee attack rolls against you. In addition, for the duration, if you and the target share a language, you can communicate telepathically with it as long as it's within 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you reach higher levels, this spell deals extra damage on a hit. At 5th level, this spell deals extra damage on a hit. At 5th, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage to the target, increasing by 1d6 at 11th level (2d6) and 17th level (3d6).</p>
