<p><em>8th-level conjuration (dunamancy:chronurgy)</em></p>

<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet<br>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a crystal prism)<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You shatter the barriers between realities and timelines, thrusting a creature into turmoil and madness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it can't take reactions until the spell ends. The affected target must also roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns; the number rolled determines what happens to the target as shown on the Reality Break Effects table.</p>
<p>At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success</p>
