_3rd-level Enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a pinch of sand)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall unconscious for the spell’s duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains unconscious for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can’t be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.
