<p><em>5th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet<br>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong>Grasses and Undergrowth.</strong> Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Trees.</strong> At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing damage from whipping branches.</p>
<p><strong>Roots and Vines.</strong> At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
<p><strong>Rocks.</strong> As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone.</p>
