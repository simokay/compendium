_6th-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self
**Components:** S, M (a glove you are wearing)
**Duration:** 8 hours

You trace a powerful protective rune on the back of your glove, leaving a ward in the form of a glowing symbol that can reflect a spell back at its caster. For the duration, whenever a creature you can see hits you with a spell attack, or whenever you fail a saving throw against a spell cast by a creature you can see, you can use a reaction to raise your gloved hand that bears the rune, forcing the caster to make an intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, you can cause the caster to reroll the spell attack that hit, or you can reroll the failed saving throw. The second roll must be used. On a failed save, the caster suffers all of the effects of that spell attack or failed saving throw and you suffer none, just as if you had never been targeted with the spell attack or forced to make the saving throw at all.

Whenever a spellcaster fails its intelligence saving throw against this spell roll a d8. If the result on the die is higher that the level of the triggering spell (or the level of the spell slot used to cast the triggering spell, if it was cast at a higher level that normal), the ward on your glove remains active and this spell continues for the duration. If not this spell ends at the end of the turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, you roll a d12 instead of a d8 to determine if the spell ends early when a creature fails its saving throw against it.
