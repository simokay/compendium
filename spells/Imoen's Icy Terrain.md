_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 20 feet
**Components:** S, M (a ball of ice) 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You surround the ground around a point you choose within range with a treacherous patch of ice that freezes and hampers your foes. Each creature in a 10-foot square centred on that point must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d4 cold damage on a failing save or half as much on a successful one.

The area becomes difficult terrain until the spell ends. For the duration, when a creature enters the spell's area or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, if falls prone.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 1st.
