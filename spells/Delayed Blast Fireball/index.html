<p><em>7th-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet<br>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.</p>
<p>If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.<br>
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.</p>
<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.</p>
