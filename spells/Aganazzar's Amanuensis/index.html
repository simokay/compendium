<p><em>1st-level transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet<br>
<strong>Components:</strong> S, M (a quill, a stick of wood, and an entire animal hide, cleansed and cured, all of which are consumed in the casting)<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Using this rare old spell, you choose one book within range and add a dozen pages to its end.</p>
<p>The pages are blank on both sides (adding space for 24 pages of writing or illustration) and made of the same material as the other pages (if the book has pages made of different materials, you choose which ones to match). This spell can make pages of paper, parchment, vellum, or other common substances, but if the book's existing pages are made of exotic or expensive materials (such as pages of beaten gold), any new pages added by this spell are composed of a mundane substitute chosen by the DM.</p>
<p>At the same instant that the spell adds the new pages, it poises an ink-dipped quill above them, floating in the air and ready for writing. The quill ceases to hover after 1 minute, or sooner if a living creature touches it. The ink on the quill is deep black and of high quality, but once it is used up, the spell does not replenish it.</p>
<p>The spell can be cast repeatedly on the same tome, expanding it as much as the caster desires.</p>
<p>Despite this spell's name, it does not write for the caster. However, it is frequently combined with other spells such as <a href="/compendium/spells/Phantom Scribe">Phantom Scribe</a>, or the similarly named <a href="/compendium/spells/Amanuensis">Amanuensis</a> cantrip, which can both inscribe the enchanted pages in various ways.</p>
