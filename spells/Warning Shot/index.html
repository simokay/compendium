<p><em>1st-level enchantment</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet
<strong>Components:</strong> V, M (a ranged weapon or spellcasting focus)
<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>With an aggressive strike you threaten to punish any creature that dares enter the space you claim as yours. Until this spell ends, whenever you hit one or more creatures with a ranged attack, you can psychically claim an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of one target that attacked. Every creature within 40 feet of a space claimed with this spell perceives the illusion of a swirling ring of red energy floating just above that space, emitting tiny sparks. These creature all know this is an illusion, but also instinctively sense the consequence for entering the space.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, if any creature willingly enters the claimed space, you can use your reaction to either make a ranged weapon attack against that creature or to cast a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action that target only that creature. If you hit the creature or it fails its saving throw, you deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the creature.</p>
<p>A space your claim with your warning shot remains claimed until the spell ends, until the space is occupied at the end of any creature's turn, or until you use this spell to claim a different space.</p>
<p><strong>A Higher Levels.</strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage inflicted by this spell increases by 1d8 for every two levels about 1st.</p>
<p>If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can have up to two spaces claimed at once. When you claim a third space, the space you've claimed longest stops being claimed</p>
