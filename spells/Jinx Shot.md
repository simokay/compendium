_Enchantment cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, M (a ranged weapon)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged weapon attack against a creature within range, otherwise, the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and your enchanted shot renders your foe unaccountably clumsy. It has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. If that attack misses, it falls prone and the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you reach higher levels, this spell deals extra damage on a hit. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d4 psychic damage to the target, increasing by 1d4 at 11th level (2d4) and 17th level (3d4)
