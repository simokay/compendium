You call out to gain the attention of creatures around you. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot cone originating from you that hears this call must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. If any affected creature within the area currently benefits from a spell that increases its speed, all of the spell's effect on that creature are suppressed until the end of your next turn.
