_Conjuration cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S 
**Duration:** 1 minute

You conjure a small amount of stone an rubble that obstructs the area. Choose a 5-foot cube that you can see within range. For the duration that area becomes difficult terrain. When the spell ends, the conjured debris vanishes as if it had never existed.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have a number of 5-foot cubes equal to your proficiency bonus under the effects of this spell at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
