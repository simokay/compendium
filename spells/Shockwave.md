_3rd-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet
**Components:** V, S , M (a small sphere of carved crystal)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell--created as an alternative to fireball for battles on crowed streets--you create a burst of concussive force that disorients victims without causing permanent harm. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centred on a point you choose within range must make a Constitution saving throw. A target takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you can choose to knock creatures unconscious instead of killing them. When you do so, any creature that this spell reduces to 0 hit points falls unconscious and is stable.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
