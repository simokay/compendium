You extend your senses to perceive the near future. For the duration, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on all Wisdom checks and initiative rolls
- Once per round, when you hit a creature that  hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet with an attack roll, that attack deals an extra 1d8 damage.
- If you're surprised, you can choose to immediately end the spell (no action required). When you do so, you are no longer surprised.
- If You're attacked, you can use your reaction to immediately end this spell. When you do so, all attack rolls against you, including the triggering attack, are made at disadvantage until the start of your next turn.
- If you roll a Dexterity save, you can use your reaction to immediately end this spell. When you do so, you gain advantage on all Dexterity saves, including the triggering save, until the start of your net turn
