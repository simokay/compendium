_2nd-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

You create a floating hand of shadow in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the shadowy hand. On a hit , the target takes 1d12 of necrotic damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throws or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

Until the spell ends, as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the shadowy hand up to 20 feet and, if you choose, repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage dealt by the hand increases by 1d12 for every two spells slots levels above 2nd.
