_1st-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V
**Duration:** 8 hours

You create a magical memory palace, a mnemonic device that focuses all the information in your mind and allows a sudden flash of future insight. Once during the duration, when you make an Intelligence check or Wisdom check, you can choose to gain a +5 bonus on that roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the outcome is determined. When you do so, the spells ends. This spell ends early if you cast it again, or if you are reduced to 0 hit points
