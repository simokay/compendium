<p><em>2nd-level evocation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S , M (a miniature scythe carved from flint)
<strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You conjure an enormous, flaming scythe at a point you can see within range. As you do you give a warning to creatures of your choice within 10 feet of that point. A creature can choose to immediately fall prone (no action or reaction needed) or to ignore your warning.</p>
<p>Immediately after any creatures you chose have responded to your warning, the fiery scythe sweeps through the air in a 10-foot-radius circle centred on that point. You choose the orientation of that circle, a two-dimensional plane, which you can choose to place above the head of prone creatures. each creature in the circle must make a dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 magical slashing damage on a failing save, or half as much on a success.</p>
<p>The fire from this spell ignites unattended objects within the circle the scythe passes through, but the objects don't take slashing damage.</p>
<p>This spell is often credited to the infamous archmage Manshoon, founder of the Zhentarim, but it is actually the creation of his former apprentice, the half-drow noble-woman Myrin Darkdance.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2rd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6, plus an extra 1d6 for every two slot levels above 3rd, and the magical slashing damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd</p>
