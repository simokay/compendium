<p><em>6th-level abjuration</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br>
<strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)<br>
<strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p>
<p>Guards and Wards creates the following effects within the warded area.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Corridors.</strong> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Doors.</strong> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an <a href="/compendium/spells/Arcane Lock">Arcane Lock</a> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the <a href="/compendium/spells/Minor Illusion">Minor Illusion</a> spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stairs.</strong> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the <a href="/compendium/spells/Web">Web</a> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while Guards and Wards lasts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other Spell Effect.</strong> You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place <a href="/compendium/spells/Dancing Lights">Dancing Lights</a> in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as Guards and Wards lasts.</li>
<li>Place <a href="/compendium/spells/Magic Mouth">Magic Mouth</a> in two locations.</li>
<li>Place <a href="/compendium/spells/Stinking Cloud">Stinking Cloud</a> in two locations. The vapours appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while Guards and Wards lasts.</li>
<li>Place a constant <a href="/compendium/spells/Gust of Wind">Gust of Wind</a> in one corridor or room.</li>
<li>Place a <a href="/compendium/spells/Suggestion">Suggestion</a> in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the Suggestion mentally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A <a href="/compendium/spells/Dispel Magic">Dispel Magic</a> cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect. You can create a permanently Guarded and Warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.</p>
