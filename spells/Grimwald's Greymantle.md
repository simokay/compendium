_5th-level necromancy_

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a skull)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a skull and cause it to glow with a silvery grey radiance. Until the spell ends you can use your action to throw the skull at a creature you can see within range. Make a range spell attack. On a miss, the skull returns to you instantly, and you choose whether it appears in your empty hand, in a container you're carrying, or at your feet. On a hit, the skull's radiance is transferred to the target, and the target can't regain hit points for the duration. Once you hit a creature with the ranged spell attack for this spell, you can't do so again for the duration.
