_3rd-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (tears inside a crystal vial worth at least 300 gp)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a shadowy raven. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Shadow Raven stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an emotion: Fury, Despair, or Fear. The creature resembles a misshapen biped marked by the chosen emotion, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drop to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after your. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and it uses its move to avoid danger.

**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast the spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell’s level appears on the stat block.
