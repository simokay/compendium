_6th-level divination (ritual)_

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes  
**Range:** Touch (1 object)
**Components:** V, S 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You can concentrate on an object you are touching, reading psychic impressions left on it by events and creatures from its past. You learn of any events within the past 24 hours that occurred within 40 feet of the object. You see, hear and smell those events from the object's point of view as if you had been there at the time.

You also see a mental image of the last creature that handled the object, from the object''s perspective, no matter how long ago the object was last held. The only information you receive about the creature is its appearance at the time (including a sense of its size), whether it was along (although you can't see any other creatures that might have been there), and a one or two word description from the DM describing that creature's emotional state the last time it touched the object (such as enraged, relaxed or satisfied), or if its mental state was too alien form you to understand, the DM will tell you that instead.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, if the object has been handled by multiple creatures within the last week, you get the same information about each creature who handled it during that time the same way you would normally receive information about the last creature who handled it.
