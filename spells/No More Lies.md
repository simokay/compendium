_3rd-level enchantment_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you make a Charisma (Intimidation)  or Wisdom (Insight)  check against a creature you can see within range
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** 1 round

You roll 1d10 and add the result to the triggering ability check, In addition, any creature you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw if it's a shapechanger, is concentrating on  a transmutation or illusion spell, or is under the effects of a spell that altered its appearance or form (such as disguise self or polymorph). On a failed save, the creature instantly reverts to its true appearance and from, and if it's maintaining concentration on a spell, that spell is suppressed until the end of your next turn, at which time any suppressed spell resumes its effect, provided that its duration has not expired.
