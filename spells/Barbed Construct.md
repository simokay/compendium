_8th-level conjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a small knot of inscribed barbed wire)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You hurl a small knot of inscribed barbed wire, which grows and springs to life, attacking your foes and protecting you from harm. A magical construct appears in the unoccupied space that you can see within range. The barbed construct uses the statistics for a shield guardian, except it doesn't have the Spell Storing trait, its fist attack deals piercing damage, and the amulet to which its bound appears as a temporary glowing tattoo around your neck until the spell ends.

The barbed construct obeys any verbal commands you issue to it. Roll initiative for the construct, which has its own turns. If you don't issue any commands to the construct it defends itself from hostile creatures and uses its <a href="{{ '/spells/Shield' | url }}">Shield</a> reaction to protect you, but otherwise takes no actions.
