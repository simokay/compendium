_1st-level evocation_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet
**Components:** V, S 
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl a crackling orb of lightning that explodes at a point you designate, engulfing all nearby creatures in its electric embrace. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centred on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures wearing armour made of metal have disadvantage on the saving throw. A target takes 2d6 lighting damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature that failed its saving throw takes a reaction before the start of its next turn, it takes extra lightning damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier

The spell only damage creature, not object, as the lightning passes through inanimate matter harmlessly.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
