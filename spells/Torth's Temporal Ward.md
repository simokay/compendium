_3rd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage  
**Range:** 5 feet
**Components:** V
**Duration:** 1 round

You warp the passage of time around yourself or a nearby ally delaying the harm it would suffer for a few precious seconds. Roll 3d12 and add your spellcasting ability modifier to the number rolled. The target gains temporary hit point equal to the total, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible.

At the end of the target's next turn it takes force damage equal to the number of temporary hit points it gained from this spell. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can roll an extra 1d12 for each spell level above 3rd
