_2nd-level abjuration_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (a bone or skull)
**Duration:** 8 hours

You sacrifice your own vitality to grant protection and health to another creature. When  you cast this spell, you touch another creature and instantly spend one or more of your current Hit Dice, up to a number equal to the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell. You don't regain any hit points when you spend Hit Dice in this manner, instead imbuing the target with your life.

Once before the spell ends, when the target takes damage, it can use its reaction to reduce that damage by an amount equal to 5 times the number of Hit Dice you chose to spend in the casting of this spell. After it reduces damage in this way, this spell ends.
