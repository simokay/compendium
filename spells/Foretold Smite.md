The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your prophetic vision of the perfect moment to strike causes your attack to deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage to the target. Additionally, you roll a d20 and record the result. The next time an attack roll is made against the target before the end of your next turn, the attacker can choose to replace the number rolled on the d20 for its attack roll with your recorded result, and the spell ends.
