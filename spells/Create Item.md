**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S 
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

From thoughts, you create matter, equipping yourself with a simple implement you need. You summon one piece of adventuring gear worth 2gp or less which you can hold in one hand and which must weigh less that 10 pounds.

If the item is more that 10 feet away from you at the end of your turn, the spell ends. This object can simulate the effects of a tool that requires proficiency, but it can only be used to make one ability check for a task that takes 1 round or less, after which time the spell ends. Anyone who hold the item or examines it closely can tell it is not real.

When the spell ends, the item disappears.
