<p><em>2nd-level Transmutation</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 bonus action<br>
<strong>Range:</strong> Self
<strong>Components:</strong> S
<strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A series of precise, meditative gesture make the essence of the world itself into your stepping stone. You can run on any object that has substance, no matter how small as if you were weightless: a cloud of dust, falling snowflakes, tiny branches, cherry blossom petals floating on the breeze, and so on. For the duration, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can climb vertically or horizontally, at any angle, though any unoccupied space, as long as there is anything more substantial than air within that space and it's not more than 50 feet above a surface on which you can stand.  The spell ends early if you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.</p>
<p>The moon elf sword-mage Quivaelyn is said to have designed this spell to emulate the ki-based movement powers of his close ally, the monk Ang Si Zhao of Tu Lung.</p>
