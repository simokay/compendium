This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

One headed (1d6+1) Thrown (20/60 ft.), versatile (1d8+1)

This spear is enchanted with 10 charges of a <a href="{{ '/spells/Daylight' | url }}">Daylight</a> spell for use in twilight or dark forest underbrush. The command phrase is "Tiamat's eyes shine," written in Draconic runes on the spear's crossguard.

**Thrown**. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
