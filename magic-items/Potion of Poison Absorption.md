Damage Resistance. Once consumed, you have resistance to poison damage.

Damage Absorption. When you take poison damage, you can use your reaction to gain immunity against that instance of the damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage you would have taken. Once this reaction is used, it can't be used again.
