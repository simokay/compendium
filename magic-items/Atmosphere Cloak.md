The hood of the cloak generates enough fresh air, even if the surrounding atmosphere is foul or unbreathable, for the wearer to breathe for anywhere from a few minutes to almost half an hour. While it does not filter the air from the outside, or remove any poisonous gases or particles, it does generate clean, refreshing air for the wearer, which protected them from poisonous gas. It's use refreshes after a long rest.
