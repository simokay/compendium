    <p>The secret of creating these silver candles is kept by four churches, those of Oghma, Deneir, Selûne, and Savras. The clergy of all these deities have agreed to keep their methods confidential.</p>
<p>When you light this candle, which requires an action, you specify the duration of its effect, ranging from 1 minute to 24 hours. When you do so, each willing creature within 10 feet of the candle vanishes, along with the candle, for the length of time you chose. For the duration, other creatures can't perceive, interact with, or affect the target in any way, and the target is unaware of its surroundings.</p>
<p>When the effect ends, each target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space. No time passes for the creature between the time of its vanishing and when it returns, and it's in exactly the same condition as when it vanished. Unlike those it caused to vanish, the candle is lost forever.</p>
