This night-blue cloak of crushed blue velvet bears silver runes on the hem, and on the right shoulder, a heraldic rendering of two towers-the symbol of Brixmarsh, a failing school of magic foolishly built on the outskirts of the Flooded Forest. These cloaks were originally created for that school, in ambitious numbers far higher than its eventual enrolment, but are now issued by the Avowed to apprentices studying under masters of the Art.

The cloak has a pocket that magically stretches to hold a single book weighing 7 pounds or less. While in the pocket, a book is protected from all moisture and its weight is reduced to one-tenth of normal, though its shape can be clearly seen bulging through the outside of the cloak. For 1 hour after a book is removed from the pocket, its pages shed a faint pale-blue light-just enough to read it by.
