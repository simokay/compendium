_Ring, uncommon_

This band of iron resembles a skull and is cold to the touch. It has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. As an action while wearing the ring, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the <a href="{{ '/spells/Fog Cloud' | url }}">Fog Cloud</a> spell from it, with the following changes: the cloud is centred on you when it first appears, and the spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required).
