Contains 3 uses, grabbing a handful of powder and throwing it at the ground as an action produces a cloud of purple smoke in a 10 ft. radius.  The cloud spreads around corners. It lasts for the 5 minutes or until strong wind disperses it. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the cloud area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there that creature must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC 16. The creature takes 1d8 poison damage on a failed save. Creatures are not affected if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.
