name: "Ring of Arachnid Control"
---
Gives the wearer the ability to control the actions of spiders possessing semi-intelligence or lower. Control is maintained as long as the wearer concentrates.

The number of spiders that can be brought under control depends on the spiders' size. If the subjected spider is a giant spider, only one could be controlled. If the spiders are of a normal size, a number between ten to forty can be controlled.

A few requirements need to be met on the wearer's side to maintain control over the spiders. 

1. the wearer needs visual contact with the spiders to be controlled.

2. the wearer needs to mentally concentrate on controlling the spiders. This concentration forces them to refrain from any actions that could break it, like spellcasting or engaging in combat.

When the ring's operation is halted, for example by breaking concentration, a one-hour gap between uses is required. The ring as 4 charges remaining, once used it becomes a normal ring.
