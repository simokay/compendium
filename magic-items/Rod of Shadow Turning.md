_Rod, Rare_

The rod is black metal in construction, and heavier that its size would suggest.

**Twisted Rod:**Â As an action you may turn the rod to transport yourself and all creatures in line of sight up to 30ft away from you into the Shadowfell. The use recharges after a long rest within the Shadowfell, or by absorbing a large amount of shadow magic at the GMs discretion.

**Expel Shadow**: As an action you may release the rods stored shadow energy and a single target within 60 feet must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. The targeted creature takes 2d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The use recharges after a long rest within the Shadowfell.
