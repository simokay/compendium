You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the loaded bolts. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw with disadvantage or take an additional 1d8 poison damage and become [[Poisoned]] for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

Proficiency with a Crossbows allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
