- as well as being a seeker working for [[Amos Riven]], he is also a member of the [[Harpers]].
- Leosin learnt the book was called [[A Hidden Temple of Amaunator]]. from a note inside it that read:
	-  To My Dearest, All great nations fall in the end, but your kindness has saved me many times over, I know you will keep our secrets safe even if we must leave our refuge. Though our faiths may be different the grace that fills you is ever inspiring. Your fellow seeker, [[Jasper]]

> It had a curious passage in it's front pages, written in the language of the yuan-ti it said:
	- Of the five there is one, within the one there is another
	- Secrets kept in many heads, let my foe become my brother
	- Which of these contains your name, seeker, weaver, maiden, mother

>"I spent a long time trying to decipher the riddle, and perhaps in desperation I drank a  too much wine and wrote in the book the word 'shekinester', thinking it was a magic tome revealed by writing. The book responded "she sought wisdom, who else will seek it?"
- to that i wrote my name.
- to that the book revealed an image of a great temple and a line drawing of a winged serpent flew down inside it. It curled itself in a chamber of the temple, and the image remained much like a map.
- then the book wrote a question?
	- What makes the wise shine like the sun?"

It was at this point [[Leosin Erlanthar]] was attacked in [[Soubar]]

- The book is now bound to Leosin until the question is answered
- Any damage done to the book will be transferred to Leosin
- the answer to the question is "the scepter of the eternal sun"
