<br />
While in bat form, the vampire can&#39;t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br />
<br />
While in mist form, the vampire can&#39;t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature&#39;s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can&#39;t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.",

<br />
While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can&#39;t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.",

- Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Sandesyl&#39;s heart while Sandesyl is incapacitated in its resting place, Sandesyl is paralyzed until the stake is removed.<br />
- Sunlight Hypersensitivity. Sandesyl takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.",

Although the target isn&#39;t under the vampire&#39;s control, it takes the vampire&#39;s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire&#39;s bite attack.<br />

Each time the vampire or the vampire&#39;s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
