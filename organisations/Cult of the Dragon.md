The Cult of the Dragon, also called the Dragon Cult and the Wearers of Purple, was a semi-religious evil organization venerating undead dragons, or dracoliches, founded by Sammaster, a powerful wizard and former Chosen of Mystra like [[Elminster]]. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faer√ªn and beyond and that it was their purpose to help this come to pass.They were considered to be a secret society or a beast cult, albeit an overly large and powerful one, and as a mercantile and criminal enterprise.
