The Cult of the Dragon, also called the Dragon Cult and the Wearers of Purple, was a semi-religious evil organization venerating undead dragons, or dracoliches, founded by a powerful wizard named  Sammaster. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faer√ªn  and that it was their purpose to help this come to pass. They were considered to be a secret society, albeit an overly large and powerful one, and also as a mercantile and criminal enterprise. Their core activities were gathering treasure for their dragon allies, and finding ways to create new dracoliches.

The highest ranked were the Wearers of Purple, named for their purple (or violet) ceremonial robes. Whilst other cultists could be found in dark grey robes.

Their many base of operations was thought to be a heavily guarded fortress called the Well of Dragons located north of the Sunset Mountains.

The leader of the cult is a dragonborn by the name of Rezmir.
