 <div class="more-info-content">
    <p>The Cult of the Dragon, also called the Dragon Cult and the Wearers of Purple, was a semi-religious evil organization venerating undead dragons, or dracoliches, founded by a powerful wizard named  Sammaster. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faer√ªn  and that it was their purpose to help this come to pass. They were considered to be a secret society, albeit an overly large and powerful one, and also as a mercantile and criminal enterprise. Their core activities were gathering treasure for their dragon allies, and finding ways to create new dracoliches.</p>
<p>The highest ranked were the Wearers of Purple, named for their purple (or violet) ceremonial robes. Whilst other cultists could be found in dark grey robes.</p>
<p>Their many base of operations was thought to be a heavily guarded fortress called the Well of Dragons located north of the Sunset Mountains.</p>
<p>The leader of the cult is a dragonborn by the name of Rezmir.</p>
