The Avowed were a group of non-denominational, cloistered monks who tended to and protected the great library-fortress of Candlekeep. They came from all walks of life; from clerics of the deities who personified the search for knowledge to wizards and even some warrior-monks. These monks were united in their scholarly pursuits and their duty to preserve the collected knowledge and lore of the Realms, in all its forms.
